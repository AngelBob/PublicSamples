# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is one of several comp-sci projects that my son was assigned in high school. No, I didn't do his homework for him. I merely put on my Professional Software Developer hat to see if there was a better solution than the one he came up with. For some value of better.

Try it, it's fun and it may surprise you.
