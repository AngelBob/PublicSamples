# D3D12PerlinTriangle

Based on the D3D12 "HelloTriangle" desktop sample app.

This implementation is not strictly a triangle. The app draws a blue square on a generated background texture. Background texture is generated by either a Perlin noise function or a checker board pattern.

Next up is some experimentation with various ways to draw the background texture. Currently a tristrip with two triangles is being used, but there should be a way to do it with a single triangle and fudging the texture coordinates...
