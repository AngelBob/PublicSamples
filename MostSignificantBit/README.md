# Most Significant Bit

A binary search method for finding the MSB of a 32- or 64-bit binary value. Binary search is relatively efficient, but if the platform supports a hardware command or intrinsic function to do this then, obviously, use that instead.

Implemented as a function, but could (probably) be re-written as a template meta-program as well.
