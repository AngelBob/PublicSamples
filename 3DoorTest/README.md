# 3DoorTest

3DoorTest is the classic "Let's Make a Deal" challenge. The player is faced with three doors. Behind one door is the grand prize, behind the other two are minor prizes. The contestant chooses a door, then the game host reveals the prize behind one of the remaining doors. The question: should the player then switch their door choice? The answer: yes.

This app runs a simulation where it randomly assigns the main "prize" to a door, randomly selects a door, "reveals" one of the non-winning doors, then switches the door choice. Average win rate is, as expected, about 2 out of 3.
