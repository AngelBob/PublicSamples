# Introduction

You are a miner during the California gold rush of 1849.  You had a successful day yesterday and cashed out some of your gold at the Assay Office before heading to the Saloon for a bit of celebration.  You wake up in your camp the next day, feeling not very chipper, and notice something is amiss...  ***your sack of gold is missing.***  

Start your quest to figure out what happened to your gold in this old California town.
