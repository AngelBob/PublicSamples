# Introduction

The games in this respository are text adventures games. For those of a certain age, think Infocom&trade;.  

A text adventure is an adventure that happens in your mind, with some help from the computer. The computer will describe the scene and it's up to you to picture it in your mind's eye. What happens next
is up to you.  

# How Does It Work?
To move around the world type a directional command like `go east`, you can also shorten that to a couple of characters `g e`. Only directional commands may be shortened in this way.  

Throughout the game you will need to acquire some objects in order to complete the story. To interact with objects in the game, just tell the computer what you want to do: `get the chair` or `examine the fork` for instance. The computer will tell you if it understood the command and whether or not it worked. The only limitation here is the command must begin with a verb.  

Use the `help` command to remind you of the game's operation  

# Seems Kinda Dumb, is it Fun?
Well, I think so.
