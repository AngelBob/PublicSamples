Samples of my code available for public consumption

This code says a lot about my coding style and much less about The Right Way&trade; to do stuff. Some of it I tried to do the right way, or close to, and some of it not so much. These projects were created for myriad reasons, and sometimes the reason was not to see if there was a better way, but to see if there was a way or to build a simpler version of the way it was being done in a more complex project.

## Things I Recommend

Play the games. Tic-Tac-Toe is fun and may (or may not) surprise you, and I really enjoyed building the Text Adventure game.

Check out the 3-Door Test. I didn't even need to run it to see what the result would be.

The Sudoku Solver is incomplete and a work-in-progress, but it does okay even without the more advanced solution techniques. This one surprised me, I thought I was pretty good at Sudoku. Coding some of the more advanced techniques will be interesting. Maybe I'll consult with ChatGPT on those.

As far as the rest, poke around if you feel like it. Maybe something here will provide inspiration for a solution.
