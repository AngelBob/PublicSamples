# Template Meta-programming

A bunch of silly stuff just to show that's it possible to do some fairly complex things at compile time:
1. The standard factorial example,
1. Spreadsheed column number to letter name,
1. Test for the existence of a structure member,
1. Build a bit-mask,
1. Naive MSB finder, and
1. Round-up to next power of 2.
