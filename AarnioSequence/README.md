# AarnioSequence

This app finds non-palindromic numbers that have integer division results when divided by the number's digits reversed. For example, the application will test 4321 / 1234 for an iteger result. Note: numbers that are palindromes are skipped as are numbers that end in zero (the reversed integer has less digits than the full integer value).

Interestingly, and unprovenly, there are exactly two "base" four digit integer values that have integer results when divided by their reversed values. For each of those values, inserting a 9 in the middle results in another value that has an integer result when divided by it's reversed value.

The question: how to prove that this holds for the insertion of any number of nines in the middle?
